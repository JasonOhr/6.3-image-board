 *A repo containing at least:
  - [ ] * `index.html`
  - [ ] * `scripts/main.js`
  - [ ] * `scripts/router.js`
  - [ ] * `scripts/models/image.js`
  - [ ] * `scripts/view/index.js`
  - [ ] * `templates/index.hbs`

### Requirements

* No JSHint warnings or errors

## Normal Mode
Using the tools you've learned in class, create a responsive image board that
allows you to add images and captions via a url. The images that are added to
the image board should be saved to tiny lasagna server, so that when you reload
the page, they are not lost. Below are screenshots of what your app should look
like.
- [ ] create View with the router callback
- [ ] Create the Router
- [ ] create the Collection/ Model (Image Collection)
- [ ] Pass the an Image  Collection to the View
- [ ] Listen to the Collection for Changes and render upon Change
- [ ] have a form to add new images to the collection (Separate view preferred)
- [ ] add to tiny lasagna


## Hard Mode

- The form to add an image should properly validate the image URL by at minimum
  checking for a http:// or https:// prefix and require a non-empty description.
- Create a login page and add the username to the images

## Notes
You'll want to create a router, create an image collection in your router,
create a view in your router callback, pass the image collection to the view,
listen to the collection for updates and rerender the view, and add new images
to the collection using the form (which should probably be a separate view, but
doesn't have to be).
